SYSTEM SEAL: ANTIGRAVITY v0.1.0-LOCKED

1. DETERMINISM STATUS: ABSOLUTE.
   The execution pipeline (Sargas -> Treneris -> Session) is immutable.
   Control flow logic is permanently decoupled from content generation.

2. INTELLIGENCE ACTIVATION: EXPLICIT.
   Intelligence is active ONLY when:
     (SYSTEM_CONFIG.MODE === 'INTELLIGENT') AND
     (SYSTEM_CONFIG.INTELLIGENCE_ENABLED === true)

3. ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM: COMPILER-GRADE.
   NarrativeOutput Interface prohibits boolean/numeric return types.
   Static Type Assertions guarantee build failure on violation.
   Injection Layer is transparent dead-code in Deterministic Mode.

4. SAFETY GUARANTEE:
   No generative model holds authority over:
     - Safety Signals (Red/Yellow/Green)
     - Training Permissions
     - Session Structural Integrity
