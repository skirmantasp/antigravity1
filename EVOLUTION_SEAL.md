# ANTIGRAVITY SYSTEM EVOLUTION SEAL
## STATUS: FINAL
## DATE: 2026-02-05

---

### I. DETERMINISM GUARANTEE
The Core Logic Pipeline (`src/agents/`) is hereby declared **IMMUTABLE**.
Execution order (`Sargas` → `Treneris` → `Session`) is **ABSOLUTE**.
Safety decisions (`RED` / `YELLOW` / `GREEN`) are derived exclusively from deterministic rule sets.
No external input, heuristic, or generative model shall ever alter the control flow or safety gates of this system.

### II. INTELLIGENCE BOUNDARY
Intelligence is **SANDBOXED** within `src/content/`.
Intelligence is permitted solely to generate **NARRATIVE**.
Intelligence is strictly **FORBIDDEN** from producing:
1.  Booleans / Flags
2.  Numerical Values
3.  State Enums
4.  Structural Directives

### III. ALLOWED EVOLUTION SURFACE
Future development is restricted to the following scopes:
1.  **Content Layer** (`src/content/`): Prompt engineering, LLM integration, and narrative refinement.
2.  **UI/UX Layer** (`src/components/`, `src/App.tsx`): Visualization and interaction patterns.
3.  **Telemetry** (`src/telemetry/`): Observation and logging.

### IV. PERMANENT INVARIANTS
1.  **Sargas Authority**: The Sargas Agent's safety output overrides all other signals.
2.  **Unidirectional Flow**: Data flows `Input` → `Safety` → `Analysis` → `Structure`. No feedback loops.
3.  **Type Safety**: The `NarrativeOutput` interface contract is non-negotiable.
